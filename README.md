# Boltzmann-equations
Set of Boltzmann equations to track the co-moving number of particles and the temperature of simple models of Dark Matter wirh strong self interactions produced via the freeze-in mechanism. The collision integrals for the number changing reactions 3<->2 are provided in the collision integrals file. The set of couple Boltzmann equations are provided in the cBE file. This code was used for the following publication https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12104, with DOI 10.1007/JHEP09(2025)083.
