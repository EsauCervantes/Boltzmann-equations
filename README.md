# Boltzmann-equations
Set of Boltzmann equations to track the co-moving number of particles and the temperature of simple models of Dark Matter wirh strong self interactions produced via the freeze-in mechanism. There is an extensions that accounts for early matter domination. The collision integrals for the number changing reactions 3<->2 are provided in the collision integrals file.
